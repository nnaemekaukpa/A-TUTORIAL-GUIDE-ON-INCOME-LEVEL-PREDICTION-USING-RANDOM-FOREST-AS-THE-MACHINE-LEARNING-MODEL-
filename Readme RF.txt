Project Title: Income Level Prediction using Random Forest as the Machine Learning Model

Overview
This code implements a machine learning pipeline to classify multi-class data with a focus on handling imbalanced datasets. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Code Structure
data_preprocessing.py

Handles data cleaning (removing NaN values, duplicates).
Encodes categorical variables.
Splits data into training and testing sets.
model_training.py

Implements the multi-class classification model.
Supports algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression.
Addresses class imbalance using techniques like class weighting.
evaluation.py

Calculates performance metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Plots confusion matrices and ROC curves for all classes.
visualization.py

Creates feature importance plots.
Generates and saves confusion matrices and other charts.
main.py

Combines all the modules to execute the entire pipeline.
Key Features
Preprocessing:

Handles missing values.
Splits data into train/test sets.
Model Training:

Multi-class classification with hyperparameter tuning.
Supports imbalance-handling strategies (e.g., SMOTE, class weighting).
Evaluation:

Performance metrics include AUC, precision, recall, and F1-scores.
Visualizes model outputs (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).
How to Use
Clone the Repository:


Confusion matrix, ROC curves, and feature importance charts saved in the output folder.
Console outputs key metrics and model performance summary.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Numpy
Future Enhancements
Add more imbalance-handling techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Implement deep learning models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
